Pony town info and other stuff
-True neutral 5w4
-You can int, but I do prefer if you could whisper to me instead of a normal interaction because sometimes I can be afk ( usually I am sleeping when I am afk )
-sometimes I may not respond to various messages, but it doesn't mean that I ignore you, I don't respond because I can't respond to them or I don't know how to respond, so please accept it
-I'm honestly really horrible at messaging first, so please understand that, it's not that I don't like you.
